They are used in a host of different applications, and as a tool for many more sophisticated data structures and algorithms. Formally, a stack is an abstract data type (ADT) such that an instance S supports the following two methods:\n","\n","- `S.push(e)`: Add element e to the top of stack S.\n","- `S.pop( )`: Remove and return the top element from the stack S; an error occurs if the stack is empty.\n","Additionally, let us deﬁne the following accessor methods for convenience:\n","- `S.top( )`: Return a reference to the top element of stack S, without removing it; an error occurs if the stack is empty.\n","- `S.is_empty( )`: Return True if stack S does not contain any elements.\n","- `len(S`): Return the number of elements in stack S; in Python, we\n","implement this with the special method __len__.\n","\n","By convention, we assume that a newly created stack is empty, and that there is no a priori bound on the capacity of the stack.
